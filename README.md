# SparklerBuddy
Arduino Code for Sparkler Writing Bot

This project was done to wave a sparkler around from a safe distance.  
We used NEMA17 stepper motors and drivers based on the L298N from STMicroelectronics.
An arduino mega is controlling our version, but an uno should work too.

Thanks for making with us!
